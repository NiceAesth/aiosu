Written by [Tasha](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/1031958), osu!weekly positioned itself as \"a weekly news digest covering the latest happenings of the game and its community\".[^osu-weekly-1]\n\nThe first ever osu! Beatmap Blueprint stickers were added to the [osu!store](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/store\/listing) on 20 March 2015. The stickers came in two packs of 8.5\" x 11\" custom sticker sheets featuring such elements as hit circles, combo counters, sliders, and much more.[^osu-stickers] In celebration of the launch, a contest was run to see who could make the best [beatmap](\/wiki\/Beatmap) using the stickers, with a first place prize of an osu! tablet and osu! sticker sets 1 and 2. Despite this, the contest was cancelled due to a lack of submissions, and no follow-up regarding this was ever publicly stated at the time.[^osu-stickers][^osu-stickers-submission-count]\n\n[Wii Remote](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wii_Remote) support was added for [osu!taiko](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!taiko) on 26 March 2015.[^osu-weekly-3] <!--changelog entry missing-->\n\nOn 31 March 2015, [osu!coins](\/wiki\/History_of_osu!\/April_Fools#osu!coins) were added as a joke in-game currency for osu! as a part of an April Fools' day joke. The coins were made to parody [free-to-play](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free-to-play) mobile games' common use of in-game currencies and [microtransactions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Microtransaction). The osu!coins were quickly removed the following day.\n\n## April\n\nThe `#balkan` channel was re-added to the game as per a [feature request](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/152009&start=0) on 2 April 2015.[^balkan-channel][^osu-weekly-4]\n\nThe [Co-op mod](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Co-op) became an unranked mod on 6 April 2015.[^osu-weekly-5]\n\n9K was made rankable after being given proper use support in the editor on 30 April 2015.[^osu-weekly-8]\n\n## May\n\n*Notice: The [forum post](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/334994) that announced news of the new ranking system was released on 4 June 2015, although the old system was actually fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and full implementation of the new system was still yet to be available to the public by the end of 2015.*\n\nThe old Beatmap Nominator (BN) ranking was fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and replaced with a new, real-time ranking. This new ranking retained the original goal of the previous one, although it focused on challenge and collaboration as opposed to individual performance over a set timeframe. Public reception towards this new change was overall mostly positive, although many users did remark that the new system was confusing.[^realtime-bn-ranking][^osu-weekly-14]\n\nAmong the changes and announcements made surrounding beatmap ranking, [a change was made to the ranking process](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/325973) on 5 May 2015 that allowed players to dispute disqualifications made by the Quality Assurance Team (QAT), due to the lack of any way to dispute issues that the QAT may bring up. The new change made it possible to submit a form if there was a dispute, where a final decision could be made regarding a beatmap and whether it is ready to be ranked.[^osu-weekly-9]\n\nThe [osu!news YouTube channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCZKQIqv9O2tddMNUMAxWaqQ) uploaded its [first video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KQbudVxEjr8) to the public on 8 May 2015. The channel was run by various members of the community and aimed to create videos on skin showcases, tournaments, mapping, contests, and other news from the community.[^osu-weekly-9][^osu-news-welcome]\n\nThe osu!keyboard (also known as the \"osu! 'nono' keyboard\") was added to the osu!store on 30 May 2015, retailing for about $40 at launch. Initially announced in a [tweet by peppy](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ppy\/status\/603797988742336512) on 28 May 2015, there were only 100 keyboards available at launch, and were more akin to a keypad than a full-sized keyboard.[^osu-weekly-12][^ppy-tweet-osu-keyboards]\n\n![](img\/osu-keyboard.jpg \"The osu! keyboard teased in a tweet by peppy\")\n\n## June\n\nImplementation of the username change system in the osu!store was set live on 16 June 2015, although full functionality of the system was not available until 18 June 2015. The changes made it so that players had to pay $4 USD for their first name change, after which the price would double with each succeeding purchase with a cap at $100 USD; however, if a user bought an [osu!supporter tag](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/home\/support), then their first change would be free. [^ppy-blog-june-04][^ppy-blog-june-16][^ppy-blog-june-17][^ppy-blog-june-18]\n\nThe ability to see what a replay would look like without [mods](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier) was added on 23 June 2015 as per a [feature request](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/97560), although the change only made the mods [Double Time](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Double_Time), [Half Time](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Half_Time), and [Flashlight](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Flashlight) togglable.[^ppy-blog-june-23]\n\n## July\n\nOn 15 July 2015, it was announced that a new public [Slack](https:\/\/slack.com\/) team was created for the purpose of better communicating with public contributors. [peppy](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/2) initially made the announcement on his blog and had explained that anyone who was willing to help test cutting-edge features, contribute graphical\/sound resources, or get help working with osu! services could come and join the team and talk to the people from different [osu! teams](\/wiki\/People\/osu!_team) directly.[^ppy-blog-july-15]\n\n*Note: There was still a private Slack team that the osu! team used for internal communications, which was not accessible or viewable to outside users; these two teams were independent of each other.*\n\nNotwithstanding, the new team was completely public and available for anyone to join, which caused many unwanted users to flood the channels. This forced peppy into \"locking down\" the new team the very next day. Despite this, peppy continued to make use of the team throughout the rest of the year, and often invited users to come and join when they were testing new features or implementations.[^ppy-blog-july-16][^ppy-blog-july-20]\n\n## August\n\nThe Chat Moderators were officially merged into the Global Moderation Team (GMT) on 20 August 2015.[^osu-weekly-24][^gmt-merge-post]\n\n## September\n\nThe old FPS counter was replaced with a new \"refresh and latency display\" on 2 September 2015. This new display would still display the current FPS (frames per second), but the new change caused it to hide from view if it exceeded 500 FPS. In addition, a new counter was added below the FPS counter that would display exactly how much latency was being introduced during frame rendering (measured in milliseconds). \"Stuttered\" or \"dropped\" frames would be shown as coloured rectangles to the left of the counter to better visualise exactly how much frame render latency a user was experiencing.[^ppy-blog-sep-mwr][^osu-weekly-29]\n\nOn 26 September 2015, [cYsmix](http:\/\/cysmix.com\/) became one of the first official osu! artists. This partnership entailed the creation of three tracks made specifically for osu!, along with the creation of a mapping contest using those tracks. The aforementioned four tracks were as follows:\n\n- [\"Manic\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-manic-osu)\n- [\"House with Legs\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-house-with-legs-osu)\n- [\"Dovregubben's Hall (New Ver.)\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-dovregubbens-hall-new-ver-osu)\n\n![](img\/cysmix-album-cover-1.jpg \"The album cover for cYsmix's first release of official osu! songs\")\n\nEach track had its own pre-timed [`.osz`](\/wiki\/Client\/File_formats\/osz_(file_format)) file included with it and were released on [cYsmix's SoundCloud](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie) on 28 September 2015.\n\nIn addition to this, an \"open bounty\" named \"Mapping With Rewards\" was created for this event, that allowed anyone to map one of the aforementioned tracks, get it into a rankable state, and if it was impressive enough, that person would receive a bounty for it. The bounty reward offered at the time was as follows: one song bundled with client (for a limited period of time), $50 osu!store credit, 6 months supporter tag, and a unique profile badge. This open bounty was reportedly created due to a need to reward players for quality beatmaps and to celebrate the new tracks without having to go through the hassle that comes with running traditional mapping contests.[^ppy-blog-sep-mwr]\n\nDespite [promises from peppy on his blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/132009865043\/mapping-with-rewards-oct-2015), however, the results for Mapping With Rewards were not posted by the end of the year.\n\n## October\n\nAfter months of work, a full migration from [DirectX](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DirectX) to [OpenGL](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenGL) graphics rendering was completed and pushed out to all users on the Stable release stream on 16 October 2015. However, users who were not able to run the new update due to compatibility issues were switched to a new release stream named \"Stable (Fallback)\", which used the old DirectX graphics rendering. It was meant to be continuously supported alongside the Stable release until the osu! team felt confident enough in the compatibility of the OpenGL rendering for all users.[^ppy-blog-june-11][^ppy-blog-july-31][^ppy-blog-august-12][^ppy-blog-september-04][^ppy-blog-october-16]\n\nAnother batch of official osu! songs were released by cYsmix on 27 October 2015, with a similar \"open-bounty\u2013style\" contest being opened for it as well. The three songs were [\"Fright March\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-fright-march-osu), [\"Moonlight Sonata\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-moonlight-sonata-osu), and [\"Classic Pursuit\"](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/olemlanglie\/cysmix-classic-pursuit-osu).[^ppy-blog-oct-mwr][^osu-weekly-34]\n\n![](img\/cysmix-album-cover-2.jpg \"The album cover for cYsmix's second release of official osu! songs\")\n\nJust like the [previous month's Mapping with Rewards contest](#september), the results were not posted before the end of the year.\n\nThe URL for the testing subdomain of the new osu! forums (jizz.ppy.sh) was replaced with new.ppy.sh on 26 October 2015 due to the explicit connotations that the old URL may have implied.[^osu-weekly-34][^new-design-post]\n\nThe first and only batch of portable osu! install USB sticks (shown below) were first announced on 30 October 2015 on [peppy's blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/), showcasing the first images of their completely metal body design. At the time of announcement, they were slated for a December 2015 release.[^osu-weekly-34][^ppy-blog-october-30]\n\n![](img\/osu-usb-stick.jpg \"Front and back side of an osu! USB stick\")\n\n## November\n\n[OWC](\/wiki\/Tournaments#osu!-world-cup) profile banners were added to the osu!store on 7\u20138 November 2015.[^ppy-blog-november-12][^osu-weekly-35]\n\nRequired email verification for certain account actions began rolling out on 16 November 2015 in response to recent events at the time involving the compromisation of numerous osu! streamers' accounts.[^ppy-blog-november-17][^ppy-blog-november-19][^osu-weekly-36] The following day, [peppy posted to his blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/133395614668\/20151117), where he initially announced the change in account security:\n\n> It has come to my attention that over the last few days a lot of osu! livestreamers have been hacked. The common link seems to be that they all had active xsplit accounts (which was hacked in 2013, leaking all passwords). This means that the said users were using the same password across twitch, twitter, osu! and more. First and foremost, if you are doing something like this, LEAVE RIGHT NOW AND CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS. Get a password manager and set one password per service!\n> Even though I am confident that osu! was not involved in the leaking of any details, I am making sure further such attempts will not result in osu! accounts being compromised. Starting yesterday I began rolling out email verification for certain account actions. Going forward, we will also be adding email verification to the game client, but this will require a touch more implementation. Expect it in the near future.\n\n\u2014 peppy, \"20151117\"[^osu-weekly-36]\n\nA few days later (19 November 2015), peppy updated users on the situation in [another blog post](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/133524244723\/20151119), in which he elaborated on the situation and kept his stance the same:\n\n> Some updates on account security:\n\n> - I am confident that osu! has not been compromised.\n> - All users which were targeted so far have used the same password for 3+ years.\n> - Many used a very simple password, or shared the password across other services.\n> - All users compromised have had at least one other account compromised in the past.\n\n> Nonetheless, I am still taking further action:\n\n> - I\u2019ve expanded the list of common passwords, and am forcefully resetting passwords of users which have these.\n> - We are on high alert and ready to help users out which are experiencing troubles.\n> - We\u2019ve made procedures for users which have invalid email addresses so they can recover their account successfully.\n> - Working on adding two-factor support (email for now) to the osu! client. Should surface very soon.\n\n> We have a lot of accounts to forcefully reset due to weak passwords, and due to limited support staff, will be staggering the \u201crollout\u201d of these resets over the coming weeks.\n\n\u2014 peppy, \"20151119\"[^ppy-blog-november-19]\n\n## References\n\n[^osu-weekly-1]: [News post by Tasha (2015-03-13) \"osu!weekly #1\"](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/home\/news\/2015-03-13-osuweekly-1)\n[^sb-rule-change]: [Forum thread by Xgor (2015-01-05) \"[Rule Change] Higher storyboard image sizes\"](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/276337&start=0)\n[^osu-stickers]: [News post by yelle (2015-03-20) \"osu!

editor too)! Database size was reduced by 10%. The ability to reset key bindings to their defaults was added. Hyperdash issues in [Catch the Beat](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!catch) was almost fixed. The main menu's copyright graphic was updated for 2013 without the copyright text. [Results for the annual \"Best of\" is out.

Taiko mode skinning now has a \"metadata\" bar (song title and artist below the playfield), taiko playfield was no longer transparent and fades in and out of kiai time. The original FAQ has been superseded by the [osu! wiki](\/wiki\/FAQ).\n\nBanchoBot's `!faq` command has been open to public for [translation](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/a\/ppy.sh\/spreadsheet\/ccc?key=0AlsSAL_F7-xDdHhUUjNSa19QendtcTdYUjE2S2hnVHc#gid=24). The legendary [BanchoBot](\/wiki\/BanchoBot) finally has a [profile](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/3)! The user panels display now adjusts to display four columns on all widescreen modes.\n\nosu!mania now support vertical flip (upside-down), making gameplay similar to that of DDR\/o2jam. Skinning now supports double-resolution sprites when the window width was greater than 1600 pixels. To add support to a skin, add images with double the width\/height containing the `@2x` suffix before the file extension (eg: `cursor@2x.png`).\n\nRanking support for [Hidden](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Hidden) and [FadeIn](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Fade_In) mods in osu!mania and lastly, less widescreen limitations in the editor when it comes to placement and selection.\n\nLinks:\n\n- [This Week in osu! \u2013 ppy blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/42178900910\/this-week-in-osu-10)\n- [This Week in osu! \u2013 ppy blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/43136384020\/this-week-in-osu-11)\n- [This Week in osu! \u2013 ppy blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/43823357969\/this-week-in-osu-12)\n- [osu! release b20130220](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/posts\/2134063)\n\n## March\n\nosu! received a complete overhaul of the UI (User Interface)! The osu! game mode received a new leitmotif symbol (previously, it was a circle with \"osu!\", was now a circle with a \"1\"). Buttons on the editor has been updated. Special mode has been combined with Song Selection menu (named under \"Mods\"), allowing players to switch modes quicker and hassle-free. All [Game Modifiers](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier) buttons received their respective image overhaul. The result screen now shows the beatmap's background image rather than user skin's result background.\n\nHit-Offset can now be known by hovering to the Accuracy from the result screen. Do note that it will disappear and can't be saved. Online Results was now hidden below the result screen rather than forcing you to see it. You can scroll down to see or you can just click the button and you will be directed to the Online Results screen.\n\nIn terms of skin, \"osu!default by peppy\" was replaced by \"osu! by peppy\" (art by [RBRat3](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/307202)). Since osu! now can support both widescreen HD and standard size, a new button was added to the \"Skins\" tab under \"Options\". By default, old skin behaviour was used for compatibility and enabling the button will force the new skin behaviour to be in effect instead. [Combo fire](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Combo_fire) was removed due to performance concerns. At the Multi side, hosts have a new special command called \"Free Mods\" and the \"Game Style\" was removed (Host can adjust the Game Style in Song Selection now under \"Mods\"). `#userlog` was introduced to showcase your recent playing achievement privately.\n\nRanking scoreboard, on the other hand, received two revisions in a single month. The first revision was \"unified scoreboards\", where the scoreboard the separated into four parts (Mods, Friends, Personal Best, Local) with score difference given below the accuracy of the layer, the removal of local scoreboard and the inability to scroll to see more of the later Top score players. Despite it was limited to osu!supporters only, it received much criticism and as such, a second revision has been issued at the near end of the month. The scoreboard was basically revered back to how it was previously, keeping the score difference gap. The prominent addition was the tabbed drop-down menu, where it house various types of ranking scoreboard. However, the new types of scoreboard \\[Country, Global (Selected Mod), and Friend\\] were still limited to osu!supporters only.\n\nLastly, player's profile picture has been added beside the grade mark of their place in the ranking scoreboard. When hovered to the tab, the placement can be known as the profile picture was darken to show the placement number. Please note that this simple addition does not affect Local scoreboard in any way, as it will most likely to be flooded with your own play results with minimum to no intrusion from other players (unless the beatmap was received from other players in folder form).\n\nLinks:\n\n- [osu!

First, it was the initial implementation of \"Collections\" support that will replace the long-standing \"Favourites A\/B\", making it simple for player to put in their favourite beatmaps in one \"Collections\" and able to share it with others by transferring the \"Collections\" rather than \"Favourites A\/B\".\n\nGame modes can now be easily switched at song selection by using `Ctrl` + `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`. A new game modifier was added specially for osu!mania, [Random](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Game_modifier\/Random). Some adjustment has been made on Multi's \"Quick Join\" button behaviour to direct you to a room with respect to your average pp against the room pp's deviation.\n\nFor beatmap replays, stale-standing comment has been switched to moving [nico-style](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nico_Nico_Douga) comment style and comment colour can now be customised (for osu!supporters only).\n\nIn the beatmapping side of things, all MAT members became BAT members as MAT has been officially dissolved since the power boundary between MAT and BAT members were too close to each other.\n\npeppy released one of the initial osu! builds from 2007 to 2009 (the one he had hoped to release for the 5th anniversary of osu!).\n\nLinks:\n\n- [This week (month) in osu! \u2013 ppy blog](https:\/\/blog.ppy.sh\/post\/46924535831\/this-week-month-in-osu-13)\n- [The end of the MAT](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/129165)\n- [osu! Public Release (2007-09)](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/130144)\n\n## May\n\nGame modifiers naming in results has been shorten (e.g. \"Hard Rock\" to \"HR\") to decease the limited space usage. *Most* of the broken replays in the past have been fixed. A new spectator system where you can follow the spectator target if they were spectating someone else. The update system has been reworked, most notably it will no longer force restarts unless required.\n\nDuring replays, half-speed replay has been added (after pressing `2x` Speed, it will show `0.5x` Speed). The playfield will not flash out the background at 100% dim. [Catch the Beat](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!catch) received joystick support (Up\/Down: change song, Right: select, Left: exit).\n\n[A new ranking\/modding system is in development](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/129625) which will replace the ancient [forum-styled modding](\/wiki\/Modding\/Forum_modding) threads.\n\nFor Multi mode, players can now use Special mod (Relax\/Autopilot\/SpunOut\/ManiaKeys) when Free Mod is enabled by the host. At the skinning side of things, widescreen taiko (taiko `@2x`) default sprites have been added. Favourite A\/B have removed completely and superseded by the Collections.\n\nThree brand new Dedication [achievements](\/wiki\/Medals) for osu!mania have been released (40,000 \/ 400,000 \/ 4,000,000 keys pressed). User profile design has been reworked and your \"last visit\" will be based on connection to Bancho (that was, in-game sign-in) rather than visits to the forum. Finally, osu! hit the milestone of having 10,000 users connected simultaneously!\n\n- [osu!

Beatmapping Contest \\#4](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/posts\/2324098) has started. As a counter-measure against players creating lots of accounts, clarity of messaging during account registration was improved and infographic showing that you can't register from phones\/tablets has been added to prevent players creating more accounts for personal reasons.\n\nAway with the security measures, users allowed to choose which game mode their profile defaults to (such as [osu!mania](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!mania), [Taiko](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!taiko)) and [last.fm](https:\/\/last.fm) support to profiles. User profiles now have country performance rank on their profile and a new pp graph.\n\nIn-game wise, the main menu gets a new visualisation, with a blazing flare around the osu! symbol dependent on intensity of currently playing song's BPM. Performance have been optimised in song selection with many (more than ten-thousand) maps. Update process robustness and performance have been improved.\n\nGameplay-wise, lead-in time was automatically add to any beatmaps which start abruptly to allow enough time to adjust [Visual Settings](\/wiki\/Client\/Interface\/Visual_settings) and total press counts for each key on the input overlay was added. For online results storages, personal best rank was show on beatmap info pages besides the \\#1 player. Score submission from mania charts was allowed and Top 50 replays was stored rather than the usual Top 40. Quick repeat sliders not reaching their maximum combo has been fixed. Disqus comments added to beatmap pages. Finally, prototype testing of score meter for all modes was underway for osu!test.\n\n![](img\/2013-06_01.jpg \"Account creation process\")\n\n![](img\/2013-06_02.jpg \"Example of attempting to create multiple accounts\")\n\n![](img\/2013-06_03.jpg \"Example of comparison in beatmap info pages\")\n\n![](img\/2013-06_04.jpg \"Example of current date user profile\")\n\n![](img\/2013-06_05.jpg \"Disqus implemented\")\n\n![](img\/2013-06_06.jpg \"New main menu visualisation\")\n\nLinks:\n\n- [June 2013 Highlights + Map of the Month](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/posts\/2400775)\n- [Regional Team Management](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/132667)\n\n## July\n\n[The new regional BATmanagers](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/132667) began their first major recruitment of new BAT in to the team with the [Summer 2013 NewBAT Applications](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/142864). This provided a chance for the new managers to adequately handle new applications. The new regional managers were [NatsumeRin](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/151679) representing Asia\/Oceania, [Kurai](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/77089) representing Europe, and [Garven](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/244216) representing America.\n\nOn 2013-07-02, peppy made the [osu!api](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/topics\/141240) open to the public (previously available only through private requests). This allowed independent developers to work on third party services for osu!. On 2013-07-11, the previously broken \"forgot password\" page has been fixed. 2013-07-18 brought updates to Bancho's fallback connectivity. On 2013-07-21, widescreen support for storyboards was added in the song setup dialog. Two new in-game overlays were added to track accuracy as you play or watch others play.

For day 1 (2013-12-21), osu! was shown as a stage event, demonstrating the game in four different game modes (osu!, Taiko, Catch the Beat, and osu!mania). For day 2 (2013-12-22), peppy gives an insight of osu! along with his future update plans at the panel room and showcased osu!tablet for the public to try it out.\n\nOne of the current hot-topic for debate right now was that peppy was making a new game mode and was testing it as a proof-in-concept (testing if it's playable, competitive or flexible enough).

Previously, only ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/2) was the admin. |\n| 2013-01-27 (06:12 UTC) | ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/2) integrated the osu! wiki with the main site design. [Link to peppy's post](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/community\/forums\/posts\/2082803). |\n| 2014 | The osu! wiki becomes an actual information centre of osu!, replacing most of the web copies such as [osu! team](\/wiki\/People\/osu!_team) and [Rules](\/wiki\/Rules). Also, the osu! wiki now has 5 admins (::{ flag=DE }:: [Loctav](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/71366) and ::{ flag=NZ }:: [deadbeat](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/128370) are added). |\n| 2015 | The osu! wiki received major translation updates from other languages. ::{ flag=PL }:: [[Dellirium]](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/519032) has been replaced by ::{ flag=FR }:: [Shiro](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/113005) as one of the admins of the osu! wiki. |\n| 2016-02-22 | The osu! wiki now has 8 admins (::{ flag=PL }:: [Ukami](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/820865) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Galkan](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/169570) are added). |\n| 2016-04-01 | One more admin joined the osu! wiki (::{ flag=PH }:: [Nathanael](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/2295078)). |\n| 2016-08-30 | The osu! wiki running on MediaWiki is being deprecated in favour of the GitHub repository version. The current osu! wiki will stay until the GitHub version is ready to be deployed with all the pages and images ported. |\n| 2017-06 | The osu! wiki running on MediaWiki is officially deprecated. The link now points to the new osu!web interface using the osu! wiki resources made in the GitHub repository.

Search service on osu!web for the osu! wiki is implemented. |\n| 2018-02-07 | Article tagging support [was implemented](https:\/\/github.com\/ppy\/osu-web\/pull\/2331) to allow better search results for wiki articles. |\n| 2018\u20132021 | *Undocumented* |\n| 2021-05-12 | [First implementation](https:\/\/github.com\/ppy\/osu-web\/pull\/7546) of infoboxes that may add additional information to articles. |\n| 2021-06-01 | Basic implementation of the osu! wiki in [osu!(lazer)](\/wiki\/Client\/Release_stream\/Lazer) [was added](https:\/\/github.com\/ppy\/osu\/pull\/12950) (English only). |\n| 2021-08-08 | Gallery support [was implemented](https:\/\/github.com\/ppy\/osu-web\/pull\/8126). Now, images from one article can be viewed at once in a gallery. |\n| 2021-08-12 | Support for footnotes [was integrated](https:\/\/github.com\/ppy\/osu-web\/pull\/8125).

It was introduced for April Fools, 2015, and allowed players to play a single [beatmap](\/wiki\/Beatmap) in exchange for an osu!coin.\n\n## Release\n\nThe [official release statement](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/home\/news\/2015-03-31-osucoins) explains that the osu!coin was introduced as a way to fund ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/users\/2)'s private jet as the current monetisation scheme wouldn't allow him to buy it in his lifetime. The statement continues, explaining that each new player would start off with 10 osu!coins, and would be given 10 more for each passing day. Existing users would get an additional two osu!coins as an added bonus. Players could then gain more osu!coins by obtaining [combo](\/wiki\/Gameplay\/Combo_(score_multiplier)). A single osu!coin would be obtained for every 100x combo.\n\n![](img\/earning-osu!coin.jpg \"An example of player getting osu!coin for each 100x combo\")\n\nWhen players would run out of osu!coins, they would be unable to play any beatmaps. Though they could purchase more \u2014 out of their own will \u2014 with the exchange rates:\n\n- $1 USD = 1 osu!coin\n- $10 USD = 10 osu!coins\n- $999 USD = 1000 osu!coins\n- first unborn child = infinite osu!coins (unborn child will work for osu!)\n\nThe following day, peppy rolled back the implementation of osu!coins, opened a new subdomain for the osu!web redesign and ended with a [remark regarding bug fixes and minor improves](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/comments\/121803).\n\n![](img\/spending-osu!coin.jpg \"An example of player spending osu!coin to play a beatmap\")\n\n## Reception\n\nThough the release of the osu!coin added additional graphical elements, it had no practical effect on the gameplay experience, as players could keep playing past the zero coin limit. Conversely, there was no way to pay for extra osu!coins either (though the option was listed as available).\n\n![](img\/purchase-osu!coin-menu.jpg \"osu!coin purchase menu\")\n\nThe update was generally well-received by players as a welcome change of pace from the otherwise strict stream of news.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- osu!academy introduces osu!coins: [Introduction to osu!coins (April Fools' 2015)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BImc5McuK1o)\n- peppy announces osu!coins: [osu!coins!](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/home\/news\/2015-03-31-osucoins)\n","path":"History_of_osu!\/April_Fools\/osu!coin","subtitle":"History of osu!
