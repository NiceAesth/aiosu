A message from the NAT will be sent once a verdict has been decided. More information on applying can be found on the website.\n\n## Basic criteria\n\nModders aiming to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfil the following criteria:\n\n- They have accumulated at least 200 [kudosu](\/wiki\/Modding\/Kudosu) for osu! modders, or 150 [kudosu](\/wiki\/Modding\/Kudosu) for osu!taiko\/osu!catch\/osu!mania modders.\n- They provide 2 to 3 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.\n\n### Modding expectations\n\nSubmitted mods should show that a user is capable of analysing and improving maps to a standard fit for the Beatmap Nominators.\n\nThe following are modding traits expected of Beatmap Nominators. Failure to display any of these traits may result in a rejected application.\n\n- **Coverage of all difficulty levels**\n- **Identification of unrankable issues, including ones tools can't detect, such as incorrect timing or metadata**\n- **Comparison between parts of a map to support issues or suggestions**\n- **Commentary about a wide variety of map elements, such as rhythm, spacing, movement, intensity, contrast, and consistency**\n- **Identification of both isolated issues and general map-wide issues**\n- **Consideration of mappers' intentions when identifying issues and giving suggestions**\n\n### How new potential Beatmap Nominators are chosen\n\n- Modders will be evaluated by the corresponding NAT members of the game mode they applied for, taking into account the following criteria:\n  - General attitude: Tone of delivery of the mods and other behavioural expectations from the [Code of Conduct](\/wiki\/Rules\/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping), as well as general behaviour in chat\/forums.\n  - Modding abilities: Knowledge of the general [Ranking Criteria](\/wiki\/Ranking_Criteria) and specific criteria of each game mode. Additional abilities like Metadata, Timing, and some others will also be taken into consideration.\n- After evaluating each modder, a discussion will be made on whether the modder will join the Beatmap Nominators.\n\n## Cooldowns\n\nDepending on your status, your cooldown before you can apply again may vary.\n\n### Failed applications\n\nYou have these requirements if you failed a Beatmap Nominator application and apply again.\n\n| Type | Cooldown |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Standard | 90 days |\n| Reduced | 45\u201360 days |\n| Failed the [Beatmap Nominator Test](\/wiki\/People\/The_Team\/Beatmap_Nominators\/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) | 30 days |\n\n### Rejoining after being removed from the Beatmap Nominators\n\nUsers who have recently left the Beatmap Nominators may have different requirements to rejoin compared to when they first joined. For users who have performed well prior to leaving, they may be able to rejoin with relaxed requirements. The NAT will inform the user if they have the opportunity to fast-track their way back into the Beatmap Nominators.\n\nIf you were a Beatmap Nominator before, these requirements apply unless you have failed an application since last time you were a Beatmap Nominator.\n\nThe 8-mod requirement for those applying after being removed for activity is shared across all modes.\n\n| Type | Cooldown | Activity Requirements |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Standard | 60 days | *N\/A* |\n| Activity | 30 days | 8 mods in 60 days |\n| Good | 30 days | *N\/A* |\n\nFormer Beatmap Nominators who resigned on good terms within the past year will become full members immediately upon rejoining.\n","path":"People\/The_Team\/Beatmap_Nominators\/Becoming_a_Beatmap_Nominator","subtitle":"Beatmap Nominators","tags":[],"title":"Becoming a Beatmap Nominator"},{"available_locales":["en","fr","ru","tr"],"layout":"markdown_page","locale":"en","markdown":"# How to start a beatmap collaboration\n\nCollaborations are one of the most difficult types of mapping to achieve. There are a lot of factors to include... Here are some tips to consider when making a collaboration.\n\n## Be sure\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n- Be sure of what **song** you are choosing.\n- Be sure to split the **parts and consider breaks**. (It's much more fun if you can split parts evenly.)\n- Be sure to both agree on the **map settings**.\n- Be sure of what **mappers** you are considering and to ask them before submitting a map. (It's polite.)\n- Be sure that you can **follow through till the end** with a collab. (That you can keep on continuing and that whoever is in the collab has to be attentive and present at all times)\n\nThis step is, in essence, a confirmation step to see whether that doing a collaboration is right for you. From this, it branches of from the dot points.\n\n## Song Selection\n\nA step that can be easily dismissed, hazardous if done so.\n\n- Choose a song that you can all agree on.\n- Timing is always an important thing.\n- Songs that have distinct changes to the music or have distinct parts are usually the ones to choose when collaborating.\n\n## Partitioning\n\nIt is usually good to have parts in which you and the other person\/people that you are working with can clearly start mapping.\n\n- First, it is advised that you bookmark your section of the song. Preferably even as possible.\n- Regardless of who starts mapping, it much more easier to go from start to finish instead of you mapping all your parts altogether. That way, it is much more easier to flow and play better.\n- Remember to partition in breaks. **Most people forget that.**\n\n## Map Settings\n\nIf you can't agree on map settings...it's going to be detrimental.\n\n- Agree on a Slider Velocity. This was a big killer for Last Time Travel and Gonna Be Here.\n- Agree on distance snapping and spacing in general. Look at [Be Your Wings](https:\/\/osu.ppy.sh\/beatmapsets\/8518).\n- Agree on difficulty settings.\n\n## Mappers\n\nThis is the part where most people go crazy. Getting mappers that you might dream about to have might not be so easy but if you do get them, you must be ready in every aspect before you start.\n\n- Develop your own mapping skills. One of the key aspects. If the person you want to collab with doesn't like how you map... You can kiss collaborating good-bye.\n- Choose someone who has a similar style to you. It can often be easier when mapping, to flow together.\n- Make sure that you all can contact each other easily... **This is important because if the people you are working with disappear for whatever reason, you are left stranded.**\n\nRemember, always keep in mind that a good map is one that takes time and is at it's highest potential. Collaborations are often one of the most hardest maps to get ranked. A few reasons being:\n\n- You have more than one mapper, and if modders find a problem in your other mappers section, your other mapper has to solve it.\n- Parts can clash and the flow of the map can be really hard to pull off.\n- Collaborations are the hardest map to start off and complete.\n\nJust remember, collaborations, despite being complex to begin and follow through, are often the most rewarding once completed.\n","path":"Guides\/Collab_Information","subtitle":"Guides","tags":[],"title":"How to start a beatmap collaboration"},{"available_locales":["de","en","fr","id","ru"],"layout":"markdown_page","locale":"en","markdown":"---\nstub: true\ntags:\n  - co op\n  - COOP\n  - CP\n  - CO\n  - mod\n  - game modifier\n  - playing with a friend\n---\n\n# Co-op (mod)\n\n![Co-op mod icon](\/wiki\/shared\/mods\/CP.png \"Co-op (CO) mod icon\")\n\n*For the full list of all mods, see: [Game modifier](\/wiki\/Game_modifier)*\\\n*Not to be confused with [Multiplayer](\/wiki\/Client\/Interface\/Multiplayer).*\n\n## About\n\n- Abbreviation: CP or CO\n- Type: Special\n- Score Multiplier: 0.70x\u20131.00x (see [table below](#score-multiplier))\n- Caption: `Double the key amount, double the fun!`\n- Compatible game modes: ![][osu!mania]\n\n## Description\n\n*Notice: Enabling the Co-op mod will result in an unranked play.*\n\nThe **Co-op** mod is a [game modifier](\/wiki\/Game_modifier) for [osu!mania](\/wiki\/Game_mode\/osu!mania) that introduces a second playfield with a second set of controls based on the current *x*K count (e.g. 7K -> 7K + 7K = 14K).
